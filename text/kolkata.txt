While Kolkata was one of the best examples of British rule in the past, at present it is a kaleidoscope of contrasting ideas, life and culture, which would be found nowhere else in the world. Kolkata is the best example of both the old and new, the orient and the occident, where lives both the poor and the rich. Kolkata mirrors warmth, culture, creativity, intellectualism and artistic development considering that Kolkata is the home to four best Nobel laureates - Rabindranath Tagore, Ronald Ross, Mother Teresa and Amartya Sen.
