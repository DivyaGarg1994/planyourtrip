GOA is a strip of land 110 kilometres long and 60 km wide, between the Sahyadri range of the Western Ghats and the Arabian sea on the west coast of India. The coastline is indented by numerous deep, sheltered river estuaries which account for the importance of Goa’s harbours on ancient trade routes. The climate is tropical with a June to September monsoon, when rainfall is approximately 400 cms. For the rest of the year humidity is surprisingly low and average daily temperature is 27°C (85°F). The coolest months are November to February when night temperat-ures can fall to 20°C (70°F) and a pull-over may be worn.

By far the most popular are Goa’s own seafood dishes. From prawns to kingfish, lobster and squid - its all available and very fresh. Other popular local food is vegetarian Thalli, Balchao (fish in spicy, red sauce), Xacati (meat or chicken cooked with coconut), Vindaloo (spicy curry), Sorpatel (spicy pork soup), Reichado (fish stuffed with spicy sauce), Fish Curry (the national dish?) and Bebinca (sweet cake made from coconut pancakes).
